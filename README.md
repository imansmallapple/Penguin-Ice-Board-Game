# Penguin Game
This is the readme file for **penguin game** for **team 07** .
The project involved the implementation of a Penguin ice board game in the C programming language. It was a group project for the EPFU subject at WUT, demonstrating my ability to work effectively in a team. The project was managed using Git and GitHub, showcasing my proficiency in version control systems.
